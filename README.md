# Take The Plunge

Take The Plunge is a website designed to help people understand the incredible benefits of cold water therapy. It does this by listing ways in which these benefits may better improve people's lives. Helping them heal from various inflammatory issues as well as aid in the balancing of hormones and energy levels.

Exceptions apply where an individual has medical conditions (cardiac, pulmonary, etc). In such conditions people should seek advice via relevant health care providers before particapting in cold water immersion. 

Another exception is age. Generally speaking children do not tolerate cold water therapy as well as adults and can run into danger quicker. Therefore it is recommended that cold water therapy be avoided by children.
